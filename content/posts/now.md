The initial idea for this came from [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs) and his [now page](https://sive.rs/now). 
I'm going to be using it to share daily or weekly updates about my study, work and my projects.
Derek always shares great content out there and still updates his now page, after 9+ years. Last I checked he was learning Mandarin, 
reading about AI and taking care of his [pet rats](https://sive.rs/rats).

I will post here frequently and share my journey as a software developer.

**What I'm working on:** This website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
I am going to be hosting this on my Hetzner instance and spining up my usual Nginx setup.
This app will live right beside my other project, [Recommendit](https://recommendit.xyz)
which is a little show recommendation app I've made in my spare time.

**What I'm reading:** [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321)
This 600-pager seems to have everything regarding building scalable and maintainable systems. I've been suggested this a few times by different developers,
and it was frequently shared on LinkedIn. With more time on my hands, it's a great way to sharpen your skills. I might keep a separate notes-blog for this.

**A great playlist I'm listening to:** [CBS: Pop Rock and Funk Records from Yugoslavia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC5yuzh3gXE&t=1172s&ab_channel=MAJ)
Great lists of underrated songs from the 70s that you've never listened to.
